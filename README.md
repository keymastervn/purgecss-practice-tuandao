Remove unused css is important in production. With the help of postcss and purgecss we can achieve 80% css size reduced at our first loading.

People who buy beautiful theme for their application trade good productivity for 'orphanage code', they are ashamed of a red light house audit by a scary stupid js bundler.

However, every decision on buying theme is smart.
